# LiburanKuy
This project is an Android-based tourist information system application in West Bandung, Indonesia that I built with my colleagues on campus, namely:

1. Fadlul Aufar
2. Fadjrin Diraja Muhammad
3. Rachma Alifia
4. Rifdah Larasati
5. Seni Siti Inayah

In the implementation, we use the Java programming language in the development process, also assisted by Figma in the process of designing the UI/UX of this application.
